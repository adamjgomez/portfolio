<h5 class='mb-4'>Last Updated April 3, 2017</h5>
<p>
Neo Finance, Inc. ("Neo") is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our website, located at neoverify.com ("Site") and the services made available through the Site ("Services").
</p>
<p>
Neo will not rent or sell your personal information to third parties. Neo may share some of your personal data (e.g. banking information and name to deposit funds) with our network of third party lenders to facilitate your loan transactions.
</p>
<p>
When you create an account on Neo, we collect basic information about you through the registration process - your name, email address, and a means to authenticate your account (for example, a password). You may also be asked to provide other information (for example, your occupation, your physical address, your city/state/country of residence, employer and education history, family information) to facilitate your loan transaction. Our Services require access to your FI Account Data. We use a third party service provider to facilitate the aggregation of your FI Account Data from your Financial Institutions, including, but not limited to, storing your FI Access Information, accessing your FI Account Data, and retrieving your FI Account Data from such third party financial institutions. As you use additional features of the Website, we may collect the additional information you enter.
</p>
<p>
By using Neo, you agree to receive emails or other written communication, such as physical mail, based on your account status or activity (for example, confirmation of email address or password changes, or customer service inquiries regarding the status of or activity in your account).
</p>
<p>
By default, you may receive periodic newsletter emails from Neo. The frequency of these newsletters may vary. You can choose not to receive these newsletters through a preference on the Website as well as opt-out directly from the email.
</p>
<p>
Neo will not disclose your personally identifiable lending activity to any third party without consent. Neo may use your data in an anonymous and aggregated form to conduct certain analytical research, performance tracking and benchmarking.  We may also publish research data comprised of anonymous aggregate data from time to time, and may use, display, distribute or license such aggregated research de-identified, anonymized, data to third parties for purposes of helping us improve our products and services.
</p>
<p>
Neo's service providers, agents and representatives may be provided access to your personally identifiable information as part of, or incident to, their provision of services to Neo (for example, processing of loan transactions). All such access shall be under appropriate confidentiality agreements and limited to use to provide services to Neo.
</p>
<p>
If you follow any links which remove you from the Website, this Privacy Policy no longer applies - i.e., Neo does not control the privacy policies or the privacy practices of any third parties and use of those third party sites are governed by those third party sites' respective terms of use and privacy policies.
